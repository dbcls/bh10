[[PageOutline]] 

In systems biology field, most curated models are developed by for example [http://www.celldesigner.org/ CellDesigner], and are described in [http://sbml.org/Main_Page SBML] format. Each model is publised in each paper, and in each SBML file. To integrate published models,  semantic web approach is very useful. BioPAX provides a common exchange format for biological pathways and models in OWL. http://www.biopax.org/

= Goal =
Goal is first of all an integration of curated models, in other words, pathways. As described above, each pathway is publised in each paper, and in each SBML file. However, as you know, pathways are closely related each other. If we can integrate these curated pathways, we can overview pathways and search pathways to find novel hypothesis. It will be very helpful for us to obtain novel insight and hypothesis.

= Usecase - Alzheimer disease pathway =
One usecase is Alzheimer disease study. We has developed a curated pathway database for Alzheimer disease named AlzPathway. AlzPathway collects signaling and metabolic pathways relevant to Alzheimer disease. By only AlzPathway, we already discovered novel hypothesis of relationships between amyloid beta and tau phosphorylation pathways which has been a missing link before. 

Importantly, pathways relevant to Alzheimer disease are not exclusively relevant to Alzheimer disease. For example, Alzheimer disease pathway is closely related to apoptosis pathway, and if someone published a curated model for detailed apoptosis, an integration of AlzPathway and apoptosis pathway will be very helpful for researchers in Alzheimer disease to obtain novel insight and hypothesis about relationships between Alzheimer disease and apoptosis.

= Convertor = 
=== BioPAX Level 3 ===
No convertor now.

=== BioPAX Level 2 ===
The convertor sbml2biopax from SBML to BioPAX OWL is provided by BioModels Compneur Group.
 * http://www.ebi.ac.uk/compneur-srv/sbml/convertors/SBMLtoBioPax.html

The sbml2biopax requires [http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML libSBML], and it works with the latest libSBML (libsbml.4.0.1).

{{{
$ wget http://www.ebi.ac.uk/compneur-srv/sbml/convertors/sbml2biopax-1.3.tar.gz

The sbml2biopax generate BioPAX Level 2 OWL file from given SBML file.

SPARQL end point is now under construction, and will appear soon. :-)

= Visualization = 
 * RelFinder in Virtuoso
 * BioCichlid: [http://newton.tmd.ac.jp/ BioCichlid] will support BioPAX Level 2 (now under implementing).

 * Cytoscape: [http://chianti.ucsd.edu/Cyto-2_7-beta/ Cytoscape 2.7.0 beta] supports BioPAX Level 3 by Ono-san.  See [wiki:VisualizationAndInteraction].

= Problems & ToDo =
 * BioPAX OWL might be too complicate to archive the above usecase (goal). SPARQL search might took so much time to return results. Appropriate reduction of information of SBML model is required to convert from SBML to RDF (not OWL).
 * In the case of conversion from SBML to RDF, mapping of name among models is required.
