<p>
Discussion on possibilities/need for improving data exchange between
e.g. <a class="missing wiki">InterMine?</a>, Galaxy, <a class="missing wiki">BioMart?</a>, Cytoscape...
</p>
<p>
Would typing of arbitrary data exchange improve communication between
cytoscape/ biomart/ intermine/galaxy and reduce need for glue code/
make life easier/ more robust?
</p>
<p>
Current situation:
</p>
<p>
It was felt that the current situation wasn't so bad: however it would
be nice to avoid bespoke plugins for communication.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Galaxy (<a class="ext-link" href="http://main.g2.bx.psu.edu/"><span class="icon"> </span>http://main.g2.bx.psu.edu/</a>): it is the responsibility of the user to make sure that the
type of data used is correct for the analysis being performed.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
Galaxy/BioMart (<a class="ext-link" href="http://www.biomart.org"><span class="icon"> </span>http://www.biomart.org</a>) communication: neither biomart or Galaxy deal with
semantics and communication works fine.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
Galaxy/UCSC table browser
(<a class="ext-link" href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?command=start"><span class="icon"> </span>http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?command=start</a>): &lt;details
needed&gt;
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
Cytoscape (<a class="ext-link" href="http://www.cytoscape.org)/BioMart"><span class="icon"> </span>http://www.cytoscape.org)/BioMart</a>: REST API used.  Perhaps SOAP would be better but
this still requires some development.  REST was fine for data
retrieval.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
<a class="missing wiki">BioMart?</a>: the Mart deployer decides on the meta-data layer in
biomart - the GUI uses this layer rather than the data.  It assumes
that the user understands what you are talking about.  Sometimes
points to ontologies.  Gui provides number of options but there is
nothing to stop the user mis-naming things.  cf UCSC table browser:
<a class="missing wiki">BioMart?</a> has place-holders for column descriptions, though current
these aren't used.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
Interoperation of Marts: this is the only place where must get the
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
semantics correct.  If one mart calls something a <a class="missing wiki">UniProt?</a>
identifier and the other one does too then essential that they are
refering to the same identifier.  Perhaps would be good to have
controlled name-space for this and/or a hand-shake to check that do
have matching values.
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
<a class="missing wiki">InterMine?</a> (<a class="ext-link" href="http://www.intermine.org"><span class="icon"> </span>http://www.intermine.org</a>): multiple organisms can use the same identifiers
e.g. across 12 drosophila genomes.  <a class="missing wiki">InterMines?</a> can ask each other
what data they provide but can't be sure name-spaces are
compatible.  Would be nice if <a class="missing wiki">InterMine?</a> or <a class="missing wiki">BioMart?</a> systems can talk
and discover what they have and how they could communicate.  Agreed
that would be good to have more formal description so that intended
<a class="missing wiki">InterMine?</a> talking to <a class="missing wiki">BioMart?</a> backend could be easier.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Discussed whether passing a header for column-based data would be
useful.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Available data-describing controlled vocabularies: OICR cancer data
experience is that there are rather limited naming systems.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
Thought to be a good idea to expose/ export current naming systems.
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA: <a class="ext-link" href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/"><span class="icon"> </span>http://cancergenome.nih.gov/</a>) have done
some thinking along these lines.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
Galaxy: has xml to describe file formats:
biopython/bioperl/bioruby/biojava have more-or-less agreed
filenames.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Just thinking of FASTA format for sequence there are quite a number of
Flavours:
</p>
<ul><li>DNA vs protein sequences
</li><li>use of ambiguity codes or not
</li><li>softmasked sequence vs N-masking
</li></ul><p>
Likewise for files that transmit data about genome features:
</p>
<ul><li>0-based coordinates
</li><li>1-based coordinates
</li><li>in-between-base coordinates
</li></ul><p>
A naming scheme would be useful to capture this kind of complexity.
</p>
<p>
Would be useful to have namespace that allows one to assert something
is a particular file format.  With an appropriate URI one would know
what kind of file was arriving.  Likewise if receive column of
identifiers from two sources it would be useful to know that they are
referring to the same thing.
</p>
<p>
File formats vs labelling of data itself:
</p>
<p>
BioMart/ <a class="missing wiki">InterMine?</a> can both provide column meaning "GO identifier",
but where to assert they are the same thing?
</p>
<p>
GO_ID + URI is all needed
</p>
<p>
Is there a need for a central naming authority/ namespace provider?
Given work on <a class="missing wiki">UniProt?</a> already, is EBI an natural location for this?
DDBJ/ DBCLS/ NCBI?
</p>
<p>
In a practical sense: if we want to take notions of semantics that are
already applied to RDF: what do we apply to a column of data?  Want a
standard identifier for saying a column is a column of GO identifiers.
</p>
<p>
If every item in a column has the same RDF type, then can attach the
URI of that type to the column and that is the unique identifier that
we can use to be clear about what the column contents are.
</p>
<p>
Agreed that we should use consistent URIs to label columns.

<p>
Semantics needs to be regulated regardless of the technology (So RDF
isn't necessarily the point here)
</p>
<p>
Agreed that would be good if allow semantics to be published/ exchanged
rather than absolute requirement.  Absolute requirement causes stasis
and makes things harder.  If make it easy then especially
large-scale users/providers can start to comply.
</p>
<p>
Data exchange conclusions:
*** A namespace for file formats would be useful.
</p>
<p>
*** A namespace for column of tabular data would be useful.  Could
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
also be used to describe data in other formats e.g. XML, though
this could be rather verbose.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*** Investigate whether the above exist.

applicable ?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
*** At the moment namespaces for columns is probably more important
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
than URIs for each data element in a column.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Agreed that worthwhile to pass URIs to describe columns.  Agreed that
arbitrary human-friendly names are also good.
</p>
<p>
*** Agreed to dump all BioMart/ <a class="missing wiki">InterMine?</a> column headings out, find
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
the common/commonly-used ones and work on naming.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
========== Discussion turned to genome builds:
</p>
<p>
There is no-where to go to find out if entities/ coordinates come from
the same versions of genomes.  Agreed Versioning is important.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
BioMart/ UCSC do have versions
available but not necessarily using the same namespaces.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
biomart has place-holders for versions and could easily expose these.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Issue with resources generated from'old' genome versions e.g. affy
chips: difficult to force people to use just one version of the
genome.
</p>
<p>
Can make gene identifiers unique by organism-specific prefix, or by
qualifier.
</p>
<p>
Ensembl (<a class="ext-link" href="http://www.ensembl.org"><span class="icon"> </span>http://www.ensembl.org</a>) does a good job and plans on
supporting all genomes.  ensembl: systematic
about mapping their versions to others e.g. from UCSC.
</p>
<p>
Assembly version and ensembl gene-build version are sufficient to
resolve all ambiguities.
</p>
<p>
modMine (<a class="ext-link" href="http://intermine.modencode.org"><span class="icon"> </span>http://intermine.modencode.org</a>): the modENCODE project
records the genome against which data were generated.  Liftover of
data between genomes is provided.  Currently, when export data, does
not record the genome version.
</p>
<p>
Galaxy save the data orginally sent - this makes things simpler in the
sense that the data actually used for some analysis are available
indefinitely.  Galaxy remembers what analysis was done but users may not remember why/ what
doing.  Galaxy encourages people to record the genome build
version.
</p>
<p>
Genome version summary:
* Investigate whether is there a standard available for describing genome version *
* Consider whether to base naming on ensembl genome/ annotation versions *
</p>
<p>
=========== Thoughts on RDF:
</p>
<p>
If everyone is expressing their data in RDF with a common underlying
naming scheme then large-scale data integration will be easier,
whether with a conventional warehouse or with a triple store.
</p>
<p>
Data warehouses are perhaps the wrong place to start with RDF: should
be the orginal data sources.  If warehouses self-define identifiers
then potential problems if/when original sources start generating
their own identifiers.
</p>
<p>
For modENCODE data/ OICR cancer genome data we are the data
originators so could generate IDs.
</p>
<p>
modENCODE as example: would we provide data as RDF?  Could there be
advantages?  How would the community feel about this?  RDF is vehicle:
requires ontologies.  Felt that the first thing to try would be to
represent meta-data as RDF.
</p>
<p>
Agreed that production-oriented groups have to deliver things now to
the research community - but awareness of semantics is important.
Balance between cleanliness/ rigour and getting job down now.
</p>
<p>
In some senses RDF vs databases is not an either/ or.  RDF view: does
force once to think about defining things very clearly.
</p>
<p>
Care is needed: can do RDF badly and will still work (locally) but not
good for interoperation.  Similar situation with ontology use in
databases.
