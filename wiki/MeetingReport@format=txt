Possible issues to be mentioned:
 * how can uncertainty be expressed?
 * ways to describe experimental/compuational "evidence"

Summary of Semantic Data Exchange for existing systems discussion

Before wholesale conversion to RDF are there things that can be	done
to improve existing/ legacy systems?

Members	of BioMart, CytoScape, Galaxy, InterMine and others met	to
discuss the possibilities/need for improving data exchange.

== Conclusions: ==
 * Data exchange:
    * Current systems are arbitrary but work well.
    * A namespace for file formats would be useful.
    * A namespace for column of tabular data would be useful. Could also be used to describe data in other formats e.g. XML, though this could be rather verbose.

    * At the moment namespaces for columns is probably more important than URIs for each data element in a column.

    * Maybe are applicable to the above: Ontology Lookup Service (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup) and/or Life Science Resource Name Project ( http://www.lsrn.org)

    * Agreed that worthwhile to pass URIs to describe columns for tabular data. Agreed that arbitrary human-friendly names are also good.

    * Agreed to dump all BioMart/ InterMine column headings out, find the common/commonly-used ones and work on naming.

 * Genome Builds:
    * Investigate whether is there a standard available for describing genome versions/	genome annotation versions.
    * Consider whether to base naming on ensembl as planning to cover all genomes
