=== Current Status ===
Cytoscape already has some tools related to semantic web technology:
 * [http://www.bioinformatics.org/rdfscape/wiki/Main/HomePage RDFScape Plugin] - Plugin supports for reasoning on ontologies.  Also supports query/result visualization.
 * BioPAX Reader - simply read and convert basic information stored in BioPAX level 2.
And there are some issues:
 * RDFScape is a bit hard to use for average users (biologists).  Need to refactor user interface.
 * Typing SPARQL query is powerful for hardcore users, but too difficult for biologists.
 * After Cytoscape reads BioPAX data, no semantics are used.

=== Potential Projects for Hackathon ===
 * Re-design RDFScape UI
  * User-friendly Query Builder
  * Automatic data import - load selected set of ontologies automatically
 * Internal data management - how should Cytoscape store semantics from BioPAX data files?
 * Merge networks/attributes automatically using semantics
